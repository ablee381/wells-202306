This is an applicaiton that is designed to show off using Python tools to query a database, create a visualization using Altair, and using streamlit to develop a website to perform these actions.  

We will deploy on Render.com (will update with a link once we have an active web application running). 

Note:  
*  We need to provide Render.com with an environmental variable in the configuration called `WELLS_URL` that has the connection string for connecting with the online database.  This is possible through the web interface when we create the application.
